"""Setup arco_era5.

This uses Apache Beam's recommended way to install non-python dependencies. This lets us install ecCodes for cfgrib on
Dataflow workers.

Please see the following documentation and examples for more:
- https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython
- https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/complete/juliaset/setup.py
